# Central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural network
# learns representations of the features, rather than
# requiring the programmer to design them herself.
# So why not just let the word embeddings be parameters in our model,
# and then be updated during training? This is exactly what we will do.
# We will have some latent semantic attributes that the network can,
# in principle, learn

# In summary, word embeddings are a representation of
# the *semantics* of a word, efficiently encoding semantic information
# that might be relevant to the task at hand.

# The module that allows you to use embeddings is torch.nn.Embedding,
# which takes two arguments: the vocabulary size,
# and the dimensionality of the embeddings.

Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,

Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
